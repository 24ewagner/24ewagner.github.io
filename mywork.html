		<h2>Wisconsin Athletics</h2>
		<p>My internship with the Wisconsin Athletics Department has given me the opportunity to advance in my photoshop skills. Below are some examples of my work.</p>
		<h3>Red Card Report</h3>
		<img src="images\RED CARD 11-4.png" alt="Red Card Report Email" width="250" height="420">
		<p>This is one of the graphics that I created for my internship with the Wisconsin Athletics Department. Each week, I am responsible for creating and distributing the “Red Card Report” emails that are distributed to a group of 650+ students. To do this, I first create the graphic through utilizing Adobe Photoshop. Next, I create the email through utilizing the Oracle Eloqua software, where I build the email, select the correct segment, and then schedule it to send.</p>
		<h3>Marketing Materials</h3>
		<p>I also had to photoshop and create various marketing materials for different games. Examples of these are included below.</p>

		<h2>Educational Project</h2>
	<h3>Digital Marketing Office of Sustainability Ad</h3>
	<img src="images\Ad.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing Office of Sustainabiltiy Ad" width="250" height="270">
<p>This is an ad I created for my Digital Marketing class. The objective of the ad was to encourage students to apply for the UW Office of Sustainability’s Writing Contest. To create this ad, I first looked up photos to use that were provided by the Office of Sustainability. Then, I utilized Canva to add words and graphics. Lastly, I submitted the ad to the Office of Sustainability for approval. The ad then ran on Instagram.
