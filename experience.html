	<h1>Experience</h1>
	<main>
	<p>Throughout my time at Wisconsin, I have been able to have experiences that have shaped me both professionally and personally.</p>
	
	<h2>Madison Capitols</h2>
	
	<p>I was an <strong> Game Day Operations and Marketing Intern </strong> from September 2022 to April 2023. I planned, researched, and facilitated the marketing operations for certain game nights. In addition, I executed promotions, fundraisers, and other game day operations in order for each game to go smoothly. </p>

<h2>IES Study Abroad</h2>
<p>In Summer 2023, I was a <strong>Social Media Ambassador</strong> for my study abroad program, <u>IES Abroad</u>, in Paris, France. I was responsible for posting social media content on my accounts showcasing my study abroad experience. These experiences gave me insights into digital and social media marketing.
</p>
<h2>Wisconsin Athletics</h2>
<p>For the past two years, I have been an <strong>Events and Promotional Marketing Intern</strong> with the <u>Wisconsin Athletics Department</u>. In this role, I am responsible for planning and facilitating different promotions and recognitions for gamedays. Last year, I worked with the Women’s Hockey team, and this year I am working with the Men’s Hockey team. I also work sporting events for other sports, such as football, basketball, and volleyball.
