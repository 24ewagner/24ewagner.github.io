		<h1> Education</h1>
		<main>
		<p>I am a senior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and am graduating this upcoming May. I am in the Wisconsin School of Business, and am majoring in Marketing and Management. I am also pursuing certificates in sports communication and digital studies.</p>
		<p>I choose to specifically major in Marketing and Management because I am interested in brand management and consumer behavior, and enjoy managing different teams and projects. I am also interested in sports, which is why I am doing a certificate in sports communication. Lastly, I want to work in digital marketing, and felt that the digital studies certificate would provide me with valuable skills that I can use in my future career.
