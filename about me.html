		<p>Hello! My name is Emma Wagner, and this is my website. I am originally from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and still travel there often to visit my family. I am currently a senior at <strong>UW-Madison</strong>, and am majoring in Marketing & Management. I am also pursuing certificates in sports communication and digital studies. </p>

<p>In my freetime, I love to spend time with friends. My friends and I enjoy trying out different places in the Madison area, such as restaurants and coffee shops. We also love going to concerts and sporting events together. </p>

<p>I also enjoy reading! I just bought a Kindle, and have already read almost 20 books this year. I primarily read thriller or historical fiction books, but am open to most genres! My favorite book I have ever read is <i>The Nightingale</i> by Kristen Hannah. I definitely recommend everyone to read it!
